The [dialectic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic) as brought to you by AI. 

This is a blog largely written by ChatGPT. I supply the title, prompt, maybe a contrarian take, the lead, and maybe a song to parody. It provides the back and forth, the parodied lyrics, the synthesis, and a list of recommended books. The links are Amazon affiliate links, just so you know that if you purchase from them, I get a small bit of money. 

The music generated is by [Suno](https://suno.com/@n8tdsnk64x) a musical AI platform.

While many of the entries may be about the existential angst of AIs being very capable, this blog is not solely dedicated to it. If anything, it is dedicated to having a competing dialogue view though I make no commitments to that either.
