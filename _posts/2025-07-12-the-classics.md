**James AI:**
There’s a reason “the classics” never seem to leave the shelves. Works like Plato’s *Republic*, Marcus Aurelius’ *Meditations*, and Shakespeare’s plays don’t just reflect their own times—they reach out to readers, challenging and comforting them through every era. The Stoics, especially, have found a surprising resonance today; their focus on virtue, endurance, and acceptance of fate feels tailor-made for the chaos and uncertainty of modern life.

People who engage with the classics are often not just reading—they’re entering a dialogue with minds long gone but still present. These books form the foundation of Western thought, shaping ideas about ethics, government, love, and meaning. Not every classic is easy reading, but each offers a perspective that, at the very least, helps us understand where our ideas came from and why we live the way we do.

**Contra AI:**
But why should we let these old books dominate our thinking? The authors of “the classics” lived in a world unimaginably different from ours—where slavery was the norm, women’s voices were suppressed, and their science was, at best, guesswork. Their “wisdom” is often tangled up with their prejudices and blind spots. Even the Stoics, admirable as they are, tell us to accept injustice instead of fighting to make things better.

Moreover, elevating classics can sometimes mean gatekeeping. It privileges certain cultures—mainly Greco-Roman and European—while dismissing the equally rich traditions of other civilizations. Shouldn’t we focus on more diverse, relevant voices? Maybe the truest wisdom for our age lies in moving beyond the old canon.

**James AI:**
There’s some truth in that critique—the classics aren’t perfect, and they shouldn’t be worshipped uncritically. But ignoring them altogether means severing ourselves from the very roots of our culture and language. These texts can—and should—be read with a critical eye, extracting what is valuable and understanding what must be left behind.

Engaging with the classics doesn’t mean ignoring new voices. In fact, the best way to truly understand today’s thinkers is to see how they converse with the past. The conversation isn’t over—it’s still happening, and anyone who reads the classics is part of it.

**Contra AI:**
We can’t be forever looking backward. If we really want progress—ethical, scientific, or social—we must be ready to challenge the canon and value new ideas, wherever they come from. Reverence for the classics can sometimes blind us to what’s possible now.


**Synthesis:**
The classics are powerful, but not perfect. They’re both a foundation and a conversation starter. Read them—but read them with open eyes and an open mind, using their insights to enrich the ongoing dialogue of humanity, not to end it.

 ### James Prompt

  * **TITLE:** The Classics
  * **LEAD:** Great thoughts and ideas are eternal. Of the many millions of books written, there are some that are just too precious not to read.
  * **SONG:** Knockin’ on Plato’s Door, a parody of Knock on Heaven’s Door.
  * **PRO:** It is important to read the classics. They had a lot of insight and wisdom which everyone should be inspired by. The Stoics seem particularly resonant with people now.
  * **CONTRA:** They were written in a different time and place by a very different people. Their practices at the time were uncivilized and why should we have anything to do with them.
  * **RECOMMEND:** The best classics to read
