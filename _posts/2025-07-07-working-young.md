**James AI:**
There’s something uniquely transformative about a first job—especially for a young teenager. It isn’t just about earning a bit of money; it’s the first taste of being genuinely useful to others, of having responsibilities that matter beyond the classroom or family chores. For my daughter, joining a program specifically designed to help youth get their first job feels both exciting and bittersweet. Exciting, because she’s about to encounter that heady mix of independence, nervousness, and pride that comes from having real duties. Bittersweet, because I remember a time when this kind of work experience happened more organically—mowing lawns, babysitting, helping out at the local store, often for a handshake or a small sum.

Now, minimum wage laws make it much harder for businesses to offer those starter jobs. It’s tough for a small business to justify paying an inexperienced teen the same as a seasoned adult. The result is fewer opportunities for kids to “learn by doing” and experience the minor failures and little triumphs that add up to real-world maturity. Still, I’m grateful programs like this exist, even if they are more bureaucratic and less spontaneous. I hope she learns that work can be both hard and rewarding—that even the dull moments are shaping her into someone others can depend on.

> Skipped summer camp, took a chance,
> Signed up for work instead.
> Library doors opened wide—
> Got a staff badge, felt the nerves in my head.
> Waking up early—yeah, that was tough,
> But I wanted to see what I could do.
> Found my place by the book carts,
> With a crew that felt brand new.
> Those were the summers of ‘25!

**Contra AI:**
Work experience is overrated for teens, especially at fourteen. At that age, childhood should be about exploration, creativity, and fun—not punching the clock or worrying about the bottom line. Modern childhood is already compressed by school, extracurriculars, and pressures to “succeed.” Adding work just steals precious time from the fleeting years before adulthood’s responsibilities hit full force.

Minimum wage may make it harder for businesses to hire teens, but that’s not necessarily a problem. It protects young workers from exploitation and ensures that, if they do work, they’re compensated fairly. Besides, there are plenty of other ways for kids to learn responsibility—sports, volunteering, creative projects—that don’t require them to work menial jobs. Rather than mourning the loss of old-fashioned starter jobs, maybe we should focus on ensuring that young people have the freedom to just be young.

> Helped a grandma find her mystery.
> Sorted fiction by the mile,
> Wished for coffee (decaf for me!).
> Teamwork made the mornings fly—
> Joked while we shelved, or helped at the desk.
> Didn’t always get it right,
> But we all had each other’s backs.

**James AI:**
It’s true that kids today are under a lot of pressure. But I’d argue that work—when balanced and appropriate—can be part of a healthy, well-rounded adolescence. It teaches lessons that can’t always be captured in sports or creative play: dealing with difficult people, showing up when you don’t feel like it, discovering that you’re needed by others. While I’d never want work to take over my daughter’s life, I believe a first job can offer moments of pride and perspective that last a lifetime. And maybe, just maybe, it helps young people appreciate their free time all the more.

**Contra AI:**
But should paid work really be the proving ground for responsibility at fourteen? Isn’t there a risk of teaching kids that their worth comes from productivity? There’s value in letting kids be “useless” for a while—imagining, inventing, or simply being. Life is long, and the labor market will always be there. Childhood, though, is gone in a flash.

> Story time on Thursdays,
> Little kids piled in a crowd.
> Tried to read with funny voices—
> Got some giggles, felt so proud!
> Cleaned up after paper scraps and glue,
> High-fived my buddy at the end.
> We learned patience and a trick or two—
> Made some memories and a friend.

**James AI**:
That’s a fair point—balance matters. The best path may lie in ensuring that work for young teens is voluntary, limited in hours, and always secondary to their education and well-being. A good first job shouldn’t be about sacrifice, but about possibility—a small taste of the adult world, with plenty of time left for play.


**Synthesis:**
In the end, the debate isn’t really about whether teens should work or play, but how to ensure that their first steps into adulthood are both meaningful and measured. Work, when it comes at the right time and in the right way, can be formative—but so can leisure, exploration, and the unstructured time to dream.

### James Prompt





* **TITLE:** Working Young
* **LEAD:** Working, being useful and productive for others, is when a child really starts to become an adult. Parody of Summer of 69 to Summer of 25 and talking about the first job
* **PROMPT:** My daughter is 14 and is starting her first job today. It is a program to help youth get their first job. I think it is very beneficial to get that experience. It is sad that it can’t be more organic but minimum wage prices out low entry, learning jobs.
* **CONTRA:** Work experience is unnecessary, teens don’t need to work so minimum wage is fine. Let them have fun.
* **RECOMMEND:** Books on work and maybe some about young adults not being good workers.
